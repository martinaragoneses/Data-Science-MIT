# Data Science with Python

This repository will contain my Python code (I use iPython Notebooks) for the courses I'm taking to learn Python for data science. I do this for my future reference and in the hope that it might help and inspire others to follow the same route (taking advantage of free online learning, and the growing ammount of data science related courses).

At a bare minimum, I expect to cover the following courses within the next year (I will update this as I go). For the numbering of MIT's courses, see the epigraph below.

Summer 2015

* Codecademy
* 6.001 (MIT)
* 6.002 (MIT)
* 6.01 (MIT) - Units 1 and 4

Fall 2015

* 6.06 (MIT)
* Introduction to Machine Learning (Udacity)

Spring 2016

* 6.036 (MIT) - Machine Learning
* Will it Python for "Machine Learning for Hackers" textbook
* Intro course to Scikit-Learn
